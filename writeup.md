# Just Coffee

## Abstract
The coffee industry historically has a fair-trade problem, with many coffee bean suppliers/growers not being compensated fairly for their produce and coffee buyers holding much of the buying power. Acquiring a fair-trade certification through the Fair Trade Labeling Organization International (FLO) can lead to better economic outcomes for coffee farmers; however, these certifications can be cost and time intensive--or even prohibitive--to acquire and can leave the majority of growers out in the cold, leading to a rich-get-richer scenario for growers. With that in mind, we can use data [available to us](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GRIAV8) to identify and create a network of coffee growers in Ethiopia that exist outside of the FLO certification program, but are on the cusp of being certified, to then work with in achieving FLO certification while being paid FLO prices.

## Design

This project is premised on the hypothetical that a growing cafe and roastery chain with an emphasis on ethical and sustainable consumption employed our consulting team's data science services to aid them in their mission. 

## Data

The IFPRI dataset used here, hosted on Dataverse, is composed of 27 different CSV files and encompass the results of an extensive survey issued to 1,598 different households of Ethiopian coffee growers and producers. Ultimately, ***features*** were decided upon for an initial evaluation, with features of note including level of fair trade certification, level of other certification, wether or not people under the age of 18 were employed, and ***etc***.
